## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and MySQL installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sachinkapalidigi/dpdzero
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd dpdzero
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your configurations (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, etc.).
5. Create a MySQL database and update the .env file with the database name and credentials:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
   ```
6. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- To start the application in development mode, use:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- Access the application at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Frameworks and Libraries

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and more.
- **MySQL2**: MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance.
- **Joi**: Object schema description language and validator for JavaScript objects.
- Other utilities: bcrypt, cors, dotenv, express-rate-limit, helmet, hpp, jsonwebtoken, morgan, xss-clean, nodemon (dev).

## Database Schema

1. `user` table:

- `id`: BIGINT, Primary Key, Auto Increment
- `username`: STRING, Not Null, Unique
- `email`: STRING, Not Null, Unique
- `password`: STRING, Not Null
- `full_name`: STRING, Not Null
- `age`: INTEGER, Not Null
- `gender`: STRING, Not Null

2. `record` table:

- `id`: BIGINT, Primary Key, Auto Increment
- `key`: STRING, Not Null
- `value`: TEXT, Not null
- `user_id`: BIGINT, Foreign Key to `user.id`, Not Null

```
[user]                  [record]
+------------+          +------------+
| id         |----------| user_id    |
| username   | 1      n | key        |
| email      |          | value      |
| password   |          | id         |
| fullName   |          +------------+
| age        |
| gender     |
+------------+

```

In this ERD:

- The arrow (`----------`) represents a one-to-many relationship from the `user` table to the `record` table.
- The numbers `1` and `n` represent the cardinality of the relationship. One user can have many records, but each record can only belong to one user.

## Testing

- **MySQL must be up and running**
- `npm run test` will run the tests.


## Alternate: Using docker and docker compose

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachinkapalidigi/dpdzero.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd dpdzero
```

4. Create an `.env` file in the root directory using the example provided in `.env.example` as a template. Replace the placeholder values with your configuration. Although not required since env variables are added in docker-compose file (<span style="color:red">WARNING</span>: only for the local development use case).

### Running the Application with Docker Compose

1. Build and start the application containers using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` or run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
```
